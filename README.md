## x.ai Grok IRC Chat Bot
Best darn IRC AI chat bot on the planet! xAI API doesn't hold back and is very candid unlike chatgpt.

Edit the grok.conf and keywords in the .py file to your preferred liking. Be sure to put the bot's nick in the keywords section as it only responds to keywords you've added.

Memory can be increased or decreased by: get_recent_memory(memory, user, limit=10)

Replace xai-REDACTED with your API key found here: https://console.x.ai/

X's xAI SDK reference: https://docs.x.ai/api/integrations#openai-sdk

You may need a pretentious x.com premium account and blue check like I have to access Grok's API.
