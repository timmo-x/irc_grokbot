## x.ai Grok IRC Chat Bot
Best darn IRC AI chat bot on the planet! xAI API doesn't hold back and is very candid unlike chatgpt.

Edit the chat_grok.conf and keywords in the .py file to your preferred liking. Be sure to put the bot's nick in the keywords section as it only responds to keywords added.

Memory can be increased or decreased by this line: def get_recent_memory(memory, identifier, limit=10):

Replace xai-REDACTED with your API key found here: https://console.x.ai/

Grok IRC Bot is (kinda) forked from https://github.com/knrd1/chatgpt but using x.ai's less woke API and a few other huge modifications catered for my tastes.

X's xAI SDK reference: https://docs.x.ai/api/integrations#openai-sdk
